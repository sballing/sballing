Now the implementation should support derivative and anti-derivative
This will be tested on the same function as before

	Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x^2)

This is again done using a gaussian wavelet as the activation function.

The artificial neural network succesfully interpolated the given function g(x)
Furthermore, the derivative and anti-derivative was determined
The resulting plot can be seen in 'interpolation.png'
