Print the 3 three initialized vectors
n = (0, 0, 0)
u = (2, 1, 3)
v = (4, 1, 5)

Testing the vector operators
First dot method: u*v = 24
Second dot method: u*v = 24
First cross-product method: u x v = (2, 2, -2)
Second cross-product method: u x v = (2, 2, -2)
Norm |u| = 3.74165738677394
Overriden ToString method for vector u: vec[(2, 1, 3)], standard just states "vec"
