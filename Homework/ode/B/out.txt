--------------------------------------
The RK solver now checks the acceptence condition for
every component of y and investigate the tolerance/error
ratio also for every component

Solving the ODE from SciPy as in exercise A
The path is stored in the genlists given as parameters
The result is plotted in figure 'ode_test.png'
